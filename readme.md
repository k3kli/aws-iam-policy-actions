# AWS Policy Actions File
A simple script, that generates a JSON file which contains all the actions for AWS Services, so it supports you in creating Policies in AWS CDK.
Fetches from the AWS Policy Generator (https://awspolicygen.s3.amazonaws.com/js/policies.js) and formats it a bit for better use (at least for me).
